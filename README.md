# Rootinez - A Routine Application

Welcome to Rootinez, a routine application. Our routines are our roots - we can break down virtually anything we do to routines, comprised of a series of systems. Much of one's success can be mapped back to the routines they establish, improve upon and maintain for a long period of time. However, sometimes our lives get difficult - we fall out of our routines and lose our focus.

Rootinez aims to solve two problems - to maintain a user's positive routines that propel themselves in their lives, and be there for when the going gets tough and the user falls out of their routines; the user can call back upon their established routines that have already been proven to work for them and get them back on track to make progress towards whatever goals they may have.

### Motivation

This is a passion project I have wanted to work on for a long time now. I have a big interest in the routines that successful individuals create and maintain, and find myself garnering inspiration from these individuals to improve on my own routines for my own success. Moreover, the grand goal is for a large amount of people to be able to receive a positive benefit from using an application like this.

### Build Status
